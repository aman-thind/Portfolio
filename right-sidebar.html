											<h3>Netflix Recommendation System</h3>
											<p>Netflix offers a large number of shows and movies for streaming with its recommendation system. Netflix energized research in recommender systems with its Netflix Prize competition in 2006, since then recommender systems have come a long way and have been integrated in many types of businesses. </p>
												<p>Content-based filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. It treats recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features. In this system, it tries to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present and the best-matching items are recommended. This uses information retrieval and information filtering.</p>
												<p>Generally a user profile is created and the system mostly focuses on two types of information:
												A model of the user's preference and a history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.</p>
												<p>Basically, an item profile is used (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied.</p>

											<h3>Credit Card Fraud Analysis</h3>
											<p>Credit card fraud poses a significant threat in terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility.
										TransUnion’s latest analysis of global online fraud trends have found fraudster threats against businesses have increased by 46%, since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The war against the virus has also brought about a war against digital fraud. It is essential now more than ever that companies have a robust system to tackle scams.</p>
									<p>The project aims to classify the fraudulent transactions of credit cards. The Credit Card Fraud Detection problem includes modeling credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turns out to be fraud. Such modeling will enable companies to efficiently flag a transaction which may be fraudulent.

											<h3>Safe Driving- Prediction of Insurance Claim</h3>
											<p>Auto insurance fraud can be defined as “false or misleading information that is provided to a insurance company in an attempt to have them pay unauthorized benefits to the policyholder.” The impact of insurance fraud can lead to increased insurance premiums, cutbacks on benefits and increased copayments and deductibles. </p>
												<p> To prevent this, a machine learning model is created which can classify which policy holder is likely to file a claim within one year of taking the insurance. This would also help to ensure the right premium is charged based on the policy holder’s driving history rather than only the location of the holder. A classification method is used which classifies the policy holder’s likelihood to process a claim into two classes whether there would be a claim or not based on independent variables pertinent to each holder’s history.</p>
